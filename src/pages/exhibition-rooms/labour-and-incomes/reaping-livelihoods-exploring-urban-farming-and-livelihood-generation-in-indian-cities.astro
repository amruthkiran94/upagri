                Across multiple scales, practitioners are engaging in innovative
                ways of urban farming in Indian cities. By highlighting two such
                business models: a commercial enterprise and a social
                enterprise, this video explores how these enterprises contribute
                to greater access to jobs, income, and food security, especially
                among the urban poor. Scaling up such models has the potential
                to foster a green livelihood strategy and support poverty
                alleviation in cities to meet broader Sustainable Development
                Goal targets.
