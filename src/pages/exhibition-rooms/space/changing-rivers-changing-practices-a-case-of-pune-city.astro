                Rivers are a major resource for cities, humans and biodiversity.
                Like major river-based civilisations, Pune enjoys its settlement
                on the banks of the rivers Mutha and Mula. They originate
                separately in the Sahyadri ranges in the Western Ghats. They
                traverse across Pune to converge as Mula-Mutha River, which
                further drains into the Bhima River. However, over the years,
                rampant urbanisation coupled with unsustainable population
                growth has taken its toll on the biodiversity of the region and
                the livelihoods of its inhabitants, wherein the city seems to
                have lost its connection with the river.

                Through a series of audiovisual narratives, this video showcases
                how the two rivers have transformed over the last 20 years; how
                developmental activities have altered the quality and size of
                the river; and how nature in the city is being reimagined, in
                the light of a rapidly urbanising Pune.

                In this video, citizens living by the banks of the river share
                their experiences, thereby stimulating a conversation about how
                and why practices around the rivers in Pune have changed.
