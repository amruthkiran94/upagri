            Men and women have made significant contributions to urban and
            peri-urban agriculture (UPA). However, the role of women in UPA has
            often been underestimated. As a result, there is limited information
            on the gendered division of labour in UPA in Tanzania. We undertook
            415 surveys among male and female farmers. The results show the
            percentage of men and women engaged in UPA as 49.2 percent and 50.8
            percent respectively in Morogoro, and 41.2 percent and 58.8 per cent
            respectively in Dar es Salaam. Evidently, there is a slight
            difference between the participation of men and women in the two
            regions. The survey demonstrates that women's role in UPA must not
            be underestimated. The results also indicate that women's
            participation in UPA has economic and social gains as they
            contribute to household expenditure. Therefore, it is important to
            address the gendered division of labour in the UPA.

                Results from the survey indicate that most female farmers are
                over 31 years of age; for instance, 77.4 per cent in Morogoro
                and 81.4 per cent in Dar es Salaam. They must fulfil their
                domestic duties alongside farming. The allocation of labour
                between the two roles and the amount of work they have to do is
                differentiated by their age, marital status, and number of
                children.

                 I usually wake up early in the morning to
                perform domestic activities before engaging in UPA activities. I
                donâ€™t feel that my duties as a woman hinder my ability to become
                a great farmer.

                Women with younger children have more domestic activities to
                take care of before engaging in UPA. Female farmers cultivating
                outside their households have to go back home during the day to
                perform these.

                Activities within UPA are also segregated by gender. For
                instance, activities that are considered hard are performed by
                men, including irrigation, cleaning of livestock shelters,
                preparing livestock feed, and carrying livestock waste to the
                disposal site, to mention a few. Activities such as collecting
                chicken eggs and harvesting vegetables are done by women. Some
                UPA farmers who employ labourers prefer men as they are
                considered to be more efficient. Women are hired for light work.
                For instance, in a case study in Chanika, Dar es Salaam, one
                farmer had hired 107 labourers. Only 27 per cent of these were
                female labourers. He explained it as follows:

                 Most of the activities on the poultry farm
                are male-oriented, so I have more male than female labourers.
                For example, lifting heavy chicken feed or collecting manure is
                done by men, while women clean the poultry shades and take care
                of the chicks.

                The findings also reveal that some household members participate
                in UPA activities because they believe it has made a significant
                contribution to the community. Therefore, spouses of farmers may
                assist depending on the type of activity. For example,

                 My husband assists me with the livestock
                (cattle, pigs, and chickens) at home but not with cultivation.
                He provides them food and water. When customers come to the
                house when I am not present, he assists with
                selling.
