                Urban agriculture is known to have multiple non-material
                benefits, like personal development, family bonding, and better
                quality of life. Drawing from interviews, this video looks at
                how home gardening has a positive impact on wellbeing at an
                individual level, on self-esteem and identity. It also explores
                how growing oneâ€™s own food has improved intra-household
                relationships, social networks, and community cohesion. In
                addition, the talk highlights how such improved wellbeing can
                contribute to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs),
                especially SDG2, i.e. Zero Hunger.
