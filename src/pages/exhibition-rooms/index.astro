                Urban and peri-urban agriculture (UPA) has many links to
                improving the local environment and meeting sustainability
                goals. For example, citizens recycle waste by composting kitchen
                waste, reuse greywater from their homes for watering, and reuse
                waste by using old containers and discarded paint cans as pots.
                Gardens are rich with a variety of flowers, fruits, vegetables,
                leaf matter, and soil that attract an array of insects, birds,
                and small animals, providing a haven for biodiversity. Rooftop
                and backyard gardens also cool down homes: residents report
                lower indoor temperatures directly under their gardens and this
                improves liveability, especially during the hot summer months.

                Urban agriculture contributes to several benefits like better
                physical health, improved mental wellbeing, closer communities;
                all of which improve quality of life. For some, their gardens
                were a means to bond with family and spend time with their loved
                ones. For others, it was a space where they could learn more
                about nature, plants, and insects, and value the process of food
                growing. Gardening also serves as a respite from chaotic city
                routines and a way to connect with like-minded individuals and
                enable lifelong friendships.

            <Flipcard title="Men and Women Nurturing Edible Cities" src="/assets/exhibition-rooms/ediblecities.jpg">
                Women have largely been at the forefront of urban agriculture,
                from maintaining gardens, growing fresh herbs, vegetables and
                microgreens or ensuring a nutritional diet for the family. For
                some, gardening is a passion and hobby, while for others
                gardening armed them with an identity where they ventured beyond
                their households to set up urban farming enterprises. Though
                women outnumber men in urban farming, a significant proportion
                of men are involved as well which offer both men and women to
                carve new possibilities of growing food in the city.

                Availability and accessibility to cultivable land continues to
                be a pressing challenge in urbanising areas. Despite this,
                citizens adapt to growing on balconies, terraces, rooftops, and
                empty plots. Citizens in informal settlements also engage in
                food growing, livestock and poultry rearing, often within the
                limited space available, from narrow lanes, footpaths or parapet
                walls to old containers.

            <Flipcard title="Labour and Incomes" src="/assets/exhibition-rooms/labour.jpg">
                Diverse forms of urban and peri-urban agriculture have led to
                multiple models of income generating activities for city
                dwellers, most prominently for the urban poor. In Tanzania,
                urban and peri-urban agriculture is a key livelihood for several
                people and includes food growing and livestock rearing. Having a
                dynamic supply chain, urban and peri-urban agriculture offers
                livelihood and employment opportunities across seed shops,
                farmers, transporters, wholesalers, retail sellers and
                consumers. Whereas in India, UPA has captured the growing
                service sector economy. Across the megacities of India - Pune,
                Bengaluru and Chennai - social enterprises are offering mali or
                gardening services to city-dwellers. These malis tend to be
                migrants from rural areas who already possess farming skills. To
                cater to the growing demand of fresh food in cities, several
                firms have also ventured into aquaponics, hydroponics and other
                tech-driven models, which offer various operation and
                maintenance jobs for technically-skilled youngsters in the city.
                Finally, several cooperatives and community farms in and around
                the city are providing fresh fruits, vegetables and dairy
                products to urban consumers, employing people throughout the
                supply chain.

            <Flipcard title="Food and Nutritional Diets" src="/assets/exhibition-rooms/food.jpg">
                Urban farmers grow ornamentals, microgreens, herbs, vegetables,
                and fruits. Many of them meet their daily vegetable needs like
                tomatoes, chillies, beans, okra, brinjal, and gourds, from their
                gardens. Since these were organically home-grown, it provides
                fresh, healthy, and nutritional diets. Growing local and native
                plants has also led to a revival of forgotten flavours and
                food-recipes, reviving local food cultures. During the COVID-19
                pandemic and related lockdowns, these food gardens became major
                sources of fresh herbs, fruits and vegetables for many
                households, including the urban poor.
