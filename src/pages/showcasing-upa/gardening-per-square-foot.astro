            Very often, urban gardens bring to mind lush green, compact,
            manicured gardens that aim to enhance the aesthetics of a place more
            than anything else. However, there is another side to urban
            gardensâ€”urban gardening and farming among low-income settlements or
            slums.

            Despite substantial research around urban agriculture, scant
            attention is paid to understanding the enablers, barriers, and
            outcomes of the practices in different sections of society,
            particularly low-income settlements.

            Conversing with three different types of practitioners from urban
            slums in Bengaluru, this session focuses on urban farming practices.
            It stimulates the conversation around how urban farming strengthens
            food security among the urban poor and contributes towards the
            sustainability of a city.
