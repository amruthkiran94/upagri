                Farming has had a great impact on my life and my family. I can
                pay my children's school fees. It has become the main source of
                income in my household. I am no longer financially dependent, I
                recommend other people to start farming. My plan is to have a
                big area for cultivation and even start cultivating perennial
                crops.

                Generally, urban and peri-urban activities have had a great
                impact on my life and my family. Farming has enabled me to pay
                my children’s school fees, among other expenses. It has become
                the main source of income in my household. I am no longer
                financially dependent.

                I am a widow. Through poultry keeping, I paid for my children’s
                school fees and supported them until university. I have built my
                own house and I can take care of my basic needs.

                People should engage in urban and peri-urban agriculture (UPA)
                because, based on my experience, these activities are payed
                highly compared to being employed. This is mainly because no
                human can live without food. Therefore, by practising UPA, you
                are sure of earning an income on a daily basis.
