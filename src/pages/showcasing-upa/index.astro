                    Urban agriculture and peri-urban agriculture are two
                    different terms, but often used in combination as urban and
                    peri-urban agriculture (UPA). UPA refers to farming
                    practices in geographies around human settlements. While
                    urban agriculture comprises farming areas within the bounds
                    of a city, peri-urban agriculture includes farming in places
                    on the fringes of urban areas. Urban agriculture is also
                    called intra-urban agriculture and popularly termed as urban
                    farming or urban gardening. When used in combination, it
                    refers to crop cultivation, animal husbandry, fisheries, and
                    forestry on small plots of land in and around urban centers.

            Urban agriculture and peri-urban agriculture are two different
            terms, but often used in combination as urban and peri-urban
            agriculture (UPA). UPA refers to farming practices in geographies
            around human settlements. While urban agriculture comprises farming
            areas within the bounds of a city, peri-urban agriculture includes
            farming in places on the fringes of urban areas. Urban agriculture
            is also called intra-urban agriculture and popularly termed as urban
            farming or urban gardening. When used in combination, it refers to
            crop cultivation, animal husbandry, fisheries, and forestry on small
            plots of land in and around urban centers.
        </p>
        <p>
            UPA includes a variety of livelihoods, ranging from subsistence
            production (small vegetable patches) and food processing and
            distribution at household levels to more commercialised farming at
            larger scales. UPA emerges in different locations like balconies,
            backyards, empty spaces, and terraces, and under varying
            socio-economic conditions and land tenure systems (owned, borrowed,
            encroached, collectives, and so on). Even though practiced on a
            micro scale, diversity is one of the main attributes of UPA as it
            can be adapted to a wide range of urban situations involving diverse
            stakeholders. UPA is practiced with many different approaches that
            include ground-level farming or open farming, rooftop farming,
            vertical farming, greenhouses, hydroponics, and other technologies.
            The type of plants grown in UPA largely includes food crops for
            local consumption, especially perishables, and less of staples.
            Although practiced mainly for subsistence, UPA is also emerging as
            an entrepreneurial opportunity in and around urbanising areas.

            We hope these glimpses, through videos and pictures from our project
            sites in India and Tanzania, will help you appreciate the diversity
            of UPA.
